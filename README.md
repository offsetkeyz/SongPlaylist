Song playlist

## Description
Inspired by the CodeCademy project at the end of the section on ArrayLists called "Desert Island Playlist"

My version of Song Playlist includes a Driver class with a main method, a Song class, and a Playlist class.
The Song class creates a Song with a title, artist, and length. 
The Playlist class creates an ArrayList of songs as well as a title of the playlist.
The driver povides a menu of options using the JOptionPane. The options include "Read In File", which reads in a txt file of songs, with the first line being the title, and every subsequent line is a song, with the attributes separated by commas.
  The next option is "Add Song", which adds a song at the end of the ArrayList.
  The next option is "Swap Two Songs", which finds the songs based on the title, and then switches their place in the ArrayList.
  The next option is "Print Playlist" which prints the playlist in a JOptionMessagePane.
  
If the user selects "Cancel" or "Exit" at any time, the program will terminate. Otherwise, the program will continue to run.
